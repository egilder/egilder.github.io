I'm passionate about technology and enjoy diving into learning *especially* with new technologies. I've started more projects then I'd like to admit, but had fun while doing them every time! I tinker with a little bit of everything I can try at least once, from programming to automation.

I am hoping to use this site for my own personal random ramblings as well as to help me further my own career with projects as well as just trying to stay relevant in the IT field.
