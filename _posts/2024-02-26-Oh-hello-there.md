Well, it's been a minute since I've posted. Between getting a new house, moving and stepping into a different position a work the personal projects just took a backseat. But, that being said, the idea never died out. What did happen was a transition from using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for some form of "blog" to using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for personal blog/journal. I have chosen to use a Community Plugin called [Day Planner](https://github.com/ivan-lednev/obsidian-day-planner) to keep a formatted daily journal. Recently I rediscovered the personal drive/need for "doing" something personal that could also benefit me professionally. I have decided to do a personal daily journal (for my own, not public) but do a weekly or bi-weekly post to my "blog" here on GitHub. I am hoping to use it as a space for info dumping on any new projects or tech info that I am learning about.
