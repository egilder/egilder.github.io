Hello, it's been a minute to say the least. As someone who works in the IT industry Microsoft pushed one of best Operating Systems (OS) since Windows 7 and announced the [end of life for Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-of-support). Now I personally was on Windows 11 so it wasn't an issue for me, but it did make me start to consider making a change myself. As a self proclaimed "gamer" I never strayed far from the Windows ecosystem. But as someone who likes to tinker with things I have tried many times over the years to switch to [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download) but due to one limitation or another I always had to crawl back to Windows OS. Granted this was in the early 2000's where Windows OS was dominating the market and the Linux market was for only those "hardcore" or "nerdy" types so it wasn't as accessible. Fast forward to 2023 with the launch of the [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) signaled the beginning of the adoption of gaming on Linux for not just those who "could make it work". The Steam Deck is running SteamOS which is [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) OS (yes that [meme generating](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/btw-i-use-arch) OS). With it's massive success and adoption and my inability to not tinker with things it got me thinking about making a leap.

In today's world, nothing that we interact with and or do is private, and it only keeps getting worse. As Microsoft's Windows 11 is being pushed for adoption, for home users it's become another way to advertise and monetize. Data of everything is captured and given back to Microsoft to be used to continue funding the invasion of our privacy at a very alarming rate. Coupled that with most modern browsers doing the same (Microsoft's Edge and Google's Chrome) it's almost impossible to do anything (online or not) without it being captured and sold. With the OS itself literally becoming a modern "spy", I started to consider jumping ship again. With the success of the Steam Deck and gaming on Linux I now had no reason to not consider moving to Linux.

I evaluated what I had on my computer that needed to be migrated to an external hard drive and only figured out that it was literally 2 pictures and a few backup files I started the process of data migration. During that time I was scrolling through the typical "Best Linux distro's of XXXX year", trying to pick out my new OS to adopt. While scrolling through I considered just doing what I have done for years and just use Ubuntu's desktop OS, but considering I did want to actually using it for gaming (albeit not much) I decided against it. But it got me thinking of just diving into Arch Linux as it allows for gaming as well as being a very slim (read not filled with bloatware) OS. So I imaged a [USB with the installer ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB_flash_installation_medium) and started my install.

After some trials and tribulations I was able to get my computer setup the way that I wanted (for the most part) and tested out a video game. Naturally there was bumps along the way, the video was choppy and not as smooth as on Windows. The main difference for my setup was I had bought an NVIDIA graphics card because on Windows it was one of the "better" ones. Ironically enough had I gone with AMD it would have worked flawlessly with Arch Linux. So, I ended up doing what most find themselves doing when you literally have no idea where to start troubleshooting, I just reinstalled the OS again. Arch's USB installation now offer's a "guided" install as opposed to the previous "you build it yourself" requirements. In doing so you're able to pick some of the easier to identify options like what display drivers you're wanting. In the end I had tried to not use the proprietary NVIDIA display drivers, but instead had to use it. Once I got those installed everything has just worked smoothly.

So, am I just another "I use Arch Linux" user, sure I guess. But from my experience _everything_ is better, from basic text editors supporting something like [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to the browser [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) just running faster. I love knowing that I'm installing what I want and nothing else will be installed if I don't do it. As opposed to Windows OS which in the end knows more about you then you yourself does. Now I am not a [tin foil hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_foil_hat) wearer for switching Operating Systems, I just really wanted everything to just work with less. Linux itself is a [Free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) that supports limitless customization. That's the allure for me personally, the "have my cake and eat it too" setup. In the end moving to Linux as my daily driver has not only been very fun, but also made me get excited about what I can do with it not just as a side project or hobby.

So if you're considering jumping to Linux I would _highly_ suggest trying out a [Linux Live ISO](https://pendrivelinux.com/live-cd-repository/) or even [test it out online](https://distrosea.com/)to see if you might too make the switch to a FOSS operating system!
